# bully-bot-rs

The Rust written version of a Discord bot I wrote for LSF, my friends and I's server.

Made to get a feel for writing Discord bots in Rust (and just learning Rust in general). Currently the most up to date version of the bot.

### Environment Variables

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=SOME_DISCORD_TOKEN # The Discord token used to authenticate the bot
BULLY_CHANCE=0.1 # Chance of a bully message being sent

```
